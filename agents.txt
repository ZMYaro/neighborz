1. Fill a checkerboard with agents (50/50 split)
2. Delete the four corners.
3. Delete twenty more at random.
4. Add five back in at random.

Each agent wants...
• If it has only one or two neighbors, it wants one of them to share its type.
• For three, four, or five, share types with two.
• For six, seven, or eight, share types with three.
• Empty squares are fine.

On each step, each agent...
• Moves to an empty square so that it is satisfied.
• Moves to the nearest such square.
• Or, moves to any such square at random.
• Agents processed in row-major order.
